# Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic
## KDD Cup 1999 Anomaly Detection

This project implements an anomaly detection system for network intrusion detection using the KDD Cup 1999 dataset. The system utilizes the Isolation Forest algorithm to identify anomalous network activities from normal traffic patterns. Built with Streamlit, the application provides an interactive web interface to visualize the model's performance and predict new input data.

## Features

- **Data Exploration**: View an overview of the dataset.
- **Model Training**: Train an Isolation Forest model on a balanced subset of the dataset.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Display classification metrics and ROC curve for model evaluation.
- **Prediction**: Input network features and get predictions on whether the input represents normal or anomalous behavior.
